# 1. Installing Rust

It's as simple as installing Rustup on your system and adding rustup's bin and env folder to the PATH. You can check whether rust has been properly installed by running these commands:

```BASH
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

# 2. Cargo
Cargo is a dependency management and build tool for Rust. You can add dependencies to a rust project by adding crate names and versions in the Cargo.toml file. Some basic cargo commands are:

```BASH
cargo build #Builds the rust project
cargo new $PROJECT_NAME #Creates a rust project with a custom name
cargo check #Checks the codebase for compilation errors
cargo run #Runs the latest build of the project
cargo update #Updates dependencies to their latest version
```

After adding new dependencies, they are downloaded by running cargo build. Dependencies downloaded in this way do not get updated using `cargo build`, because the version number of the crate which you installed in the beginning gets stored in the Cargo.lock file, which is a file that "locks" certain crates to their initially downloaded version. That's why the command `cargo update` exists, to force an update of all crates just like `npm upgrade` by ignoring whatever is stored in Cargo.lock
